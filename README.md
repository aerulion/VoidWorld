# VoidWorld

**VoidWorld** is a simple and lightweight world generator plugin for [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper). It creates completely empty worlds using the vanilla `the_void` biome, perfect for server hubs, creative builds, or custom maps. To use VoidWorld, adjust your bukkit.yml to specify it as the generator for a world or pair it with a plugin like Multiverse. No extra configuration â€” just a clean, blank canvas for your projects!

### Configuring the bukkit.yml File

To ensure VoidWorld handles the generation of your void worlds, it is required to update your `bukkit.yml` file. Open the file in your server directory and add the following lines at the end. Replace `world_1` and `world_2` with the names of the worlds you want to use VoidWorld for. You can list as many worlds as you need by adding more entries:

```yaml
worlds:
  world_1:
    generator: VoidWorld
  world_2:
    generator: VoidWorld
```

### Using Multiverse 5.0.0 and upwards

If you are using a multi-world management system such as [Multiverse](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core), you will probably need to modify the generator settings. In the case of Multiverse, there are three ways to do so:

#### 1. When creating a fresh / new world:

Specify the VoidWorld generator during world creation. This can be done using the following command:

``/mv create <WorldName> normal --generator VoidWorld``

#### 2. When importing a world:

Similar to creating a new world, you also need to specify the generator when importing a world:

``/mv import <WorldName> normal --generator VoidWorld``

#### 3. Modify an already existing world:

To modify the generator of an existing world in Multiverse, you need to edit the `worlds.yml` file in the Multiverse plugin directory.

Look for the world name you want to modify and change the value of the 'generator' field.

```yaml
world_1:
  generator: VoidWorld
world_2:
  generator: VoidWorld
```
